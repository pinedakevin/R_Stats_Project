## Introduction 

  During the beginning of Covid, many white-collar working adults were forced to work away from the traditional office space that many were accustomed to. Many people invested time and money into creating their own office space in their homes. People are now slowly returning to a new way of life. We are seeing more people return to an office setting or companies telling their employees to return. . 

```{r Surveys, echo=FALSE}
UK_Survey = read.csv("UK_Google_Survey.csv")
USA_Survey = read.csv("USA_Google_Survey.csv")
USA_West_Survey = read.csv("USA_West_Google_Survey.csv")

```

## Why is this important to us?

  As computer science students, we must learn how these office settings are affecting the everyday individual. We will all mostly work in an office setting so understanding how our future peers view their working environment is important for all of our futures.

## What is the study about?

 Question asked: ***"What is more important to you in a new job/career? (Regardless of salary)"***
 
 Where I did the survey: Google Surveys <https://surveys.google.com/>.

 Cost: 10-15 Cents a survey
 
 Population: US, Western US, UK
    
 Who can participate in the survey: app users that are linked to the AdMob network

## Normal Distribution UK

norm_UK = function(x) { dnorm(x, mean(UK_x), sd(UK_x)) }

norm_USAW = function(x) { dnorm(x, mean(USAW_x), sd(USAW_x)) }

plot(norm_UK, xlim=c(-100,180), ylab="Density", xlab="X", main = "Normal Distribution: UK Responses")
points(UK_x, norm_UK(UK_x))

```

## Normal Distribution USA

```{r normdistUSA, echo=FALSE}
plot(norm_USA, xlim=c(-100,180), ylab="Density", xlab="X", main = "Normal Distribution: USA Responses")
points(USA_x, norm_USA(USA_x))
```

## Job Satisfaction
```{r jobSat, echo=FALSE}
#Total Population
n = UKTotCount + USATotCount + USAWestTotCount
x = UK_JobSatCounter + USA_JobSatCounter + USAWest_JobSatCounter
binom.test(x,n, conf.level = .95)
```
## Work From Home
```{r workFromHome, echo=FALSE}
#Total Population
n = UKTotCount + USATotCount + USAWestTotCount
x = UK_WorkFrHomeCounter + USA_WorkFrHomeCounter + USAWest_WorkFrHomeCounter
binom.test(x,n, conf.level = .95)
```
## Employee Benefits
```{r employeeBen, echo=FALSE}
#Total Population
n = UKTotCount + USATotCount + USAWestTotCount
x = UK_EmployeeBenCounter + USA_EmployeeBenCounter + USAWest_EmployeeBenCounter
binom.test(x,n, conf.level = .95)
```

## Limitations
- sample population is a very small subset of the general population.
- divide the general population by a large amount.
- larger sample population may have given us competently different results
- limited due to funding (I.E. It was expensive)

## Conclusions

  The population tells us that people are leaning towards having great job satisfaction. This term can be broad, but the typical description is having a satisfying job. How does this correlate to a pandemic changing workers' perception? This does not answer our question directly. It could be many different things that can cause someone to choose that option.
